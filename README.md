Based on the Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld (BTW) models (sandplie model) and some extended sandpile models.
Introduce the rotation to models and try to extend the models to the polar system. 
The extension part attempts to build a simple star formation toy model for the spiral galaxy based on 
the idea of the BTW model and the stochastic self-propagating star formation model. 
The programming language used in the project is Matlab.
